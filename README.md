# Perceptron Training and Visualization

This project implements the perceptron training algorithm and provides a visualization of the training process. Results, including decision boundary evolution, are saved in the `results` folder. Data distribution is shown in `train_data.png`.

## Getting Started

To view dataset, run `DisplayData.m`.

To train the perceptron and generate visualizations, run main.m in MATLAB.
